                <p>That we the black people are one people we know. Destroyers
                    will travel long distances in their minds and out to deny you this
                    truth.— Ayi Kwei Armah</p>
                <p>Make a drumbeat, Put it on a record, let it whirl, And while we
                    listen to it play, Dance with you till day—Langston Hughes</p>
                <p>And the day finally came</p>
                <p>Toni Morrison declares that the “forced transfer” of African people is the

                    “defining event of the modern world” (“Home” 10). The arrival of cap-
                    tive Africans to North America, their enslavement, and their continued
                    survival, represents a journey of remarkable resiliency. Besides enslaving
                    African people, the deliberate mission of Europeans included efforts to
                    destroy them by attempting to wipe out their traditions, substituting their
                    languages, and desecrating their cultures. To reiterate, this experience of
                    Africans in America has been a quintessential example of adaptation in the
                    face of adversity.
                    
                    That they managed to continue on with any measure of
                    psychic integrity is a tribute to the dynamic role that culture plays in the
                    lives of people.
                    
                    A necessary element of life, culture is the medium through which hu-
                    mans exercise their humanity and express and affirm their view of reality.
                    For members of the African diaspora, culture surpassed its role to provide
                    self-definition and sustain the group ethos; it became a way to physically
                    survive. As a site of cosmic connection, identity, meaning, and values were
                    made and remade in order to resist. Through the tenacious practice of cul-
                    ture, Africans endured in America. This worldview bears witness to the
                    strength of the survivors of one of the cruelest systems of human oppres-
                    sion witnessed in human history. Because of this, African culture became
                    stronger as the group faced cultural extinction from external forces.</p>
